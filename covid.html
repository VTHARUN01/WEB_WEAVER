               <B> Dear clients, </B> <br><br>

We are very much looking forward to welcoming you here soon.<br><br>


Regarding the Covid19 safety measures: we are closely following the guidelines of the government of respective countries. Currently the following measures are implemented, please note that these protocols can change at any given time, we kindly ask you to contact us closer to your arrival date if you would like to be informed of the measure in place during your stay.<br><br>


Current safety measures at the Fusion Hotels: <br><br>


•  Please keep a distance of 1.5 meters from other guests and hotel employees. <br><br>



•  The elevator may only be shared by people who live in the same household.<br><br>
•  Our public spaces are regularly disinfected and aerated. Liquid disinfectant is at your disposal.<br><br>

•  The close contact with our team members is minimized. At the reception there are Plexiglas barriers,on demand we will of course show you to your room and make a hotel tour upon check-in.<br><br>


• Our porters wear masks in the electrical car when picking you up and driving you to the train station/airport upon arrival and departure.<br><br>


• To avoid crowds in the reception area, we recommend that you settle your bill the evening before or early on the day of check-out at the reception (peak times to be avoided on the weekend & holiday times are 9.30am-11.00am).<br><br>


•  Your room is cleaned daily and the surfaces are disinfected. Please attach the red (do not disturb) card to your room door in case you do not require cleaning. You are also welcome to let reception know if this applies to the entire stay or if you have special requests in this regard. The turndown service in the evening will only be carried out on request.<br><br>



•  The breakfast and salad buffet is equipped with plexiglass. Guests must use single-use gloves when serving themselves at the buffet, and dispose of them after every course. Alternatively you can order breakfast room service.<br><br>


•  Social distancing is enforced between the restaurant tables. The capacity of our restaurants is therefore very reduced and we recommend to reserve your tables well before your arrival.<br><br>


•  For safety reasons, the in-room information booklet will no longer be distributed. With pleasure we will provide you an e-book(via mail) containing all the information of the hotel, at the reception.<br><br>


•  The reception offers you hygiene kits (disinfectant, mask, etc.).<br><br>


For further information we remain at your disposal anytime.<br><br>


With warm regards from team Fusion,
